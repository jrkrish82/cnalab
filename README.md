# Migration Evolution

## Background
This repository demonstrates a possible evolution for
a demonstration architecture. It assumes that the [bounded
contexts](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html) for the application
follow the boundaries outlined.

## Evolution tags

Tags are used to show the evolution of the application from one application
that leverages components to a distributed system of microservices.

```
git tag -ln

v1      One Application that leverages components
v2      Billing component promoted to a service
v3      Add Eureka service discovery to allow easy service communication
v4      Add Hystrix for service resiliency
v5      Add distributed configuration server
v6      Add asynchronous processing with RabbitMQ

```

See RUNNING.md for details on how to build/run the applications.
